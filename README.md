Overview
This repository contains three small Python projects designed for beginners:

A Simple Calculator to perform basic arithmetic operations.
A Number Guessing Game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range.
A To-Do List application to manage daily tasks.
These projects are easy to understand and serve as great practice for learning Python's syntax, control flow, and basic data structures.

Features
Simple Calculator: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations.
Number Guessing Game: Generates a random number and provides feedback to the user for each guess.
To-Do List: Allows users to add, view, and remove tasks.
Installation
To run these applications on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator-guess-todolist.git
cd calculator-guess-todolist
Install the required dependencies: These applications are written in pure Python, so no external libraries are needed. Just make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.

Run the applications individually as Python scripts:

bash
Copy code
python simple_calculator.py
python number_guess.py
python todo_list.py
Usage
Simple Calculator
This application allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations.

How to use:

The program will prompt for the operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
Then, input the two numbers.
The result will be displayed.
Number Guessing Game
This game generates a random number between a specific range, and the user has to guess it. After each guess, the program will inform the user if the guess was too high, too low, or correct.

How to play:

The game will randomly choose a number between 1 and 100.
You enter your guess.
Keep guessing until you get the correct number!
To-Do List
This is a simple task manager where you can add, view, and delete tasks from your to-do list.

Features:

Add new tasks
Display all tasks
Remove tasks from the list
How to use:

Run the program and follow the instructions to add or remove tasks.
You can view your current task list anytime during the program.
